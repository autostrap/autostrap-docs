[TOC]

In this section we will give a brief rundown of all the components that make up
Autostrap. It lists all the git repositories the components of Autostrap
reside in and gives a high-level description of these components. All
repositories are on Github, with links provided in this section.

A note to users: for setting up your service cloud, you will usually only need
a fork of [project-config][src::project-config] and a checkout of
[autostrap-utils][src::autostrap-utils]. The latter is optional but recommended
since it provides convenient development tools.
