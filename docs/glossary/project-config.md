project-config is a Git repository that contains configuration specific to a
given project. It complements and overrides Autostrap's default configuration
in the [global-config][src::global-config] repository. For
reference on its structure and semantics we provide an
[example project-config repository][src::project-config].
Feel free to fork this repository and use it as a base for your own
project-config repository.
